# face-shape-recognition-system 
The main goal of this project is to categorize face shapes into six groups which are predefined by face specialists. Diamond,Square,Oblong,Rectangle,Oval and triangle are those six groups. Here I used 68 land mask detector which extracts 68 features of a face.
Simple machine learning algorithm KNN  is used to train the data set. Here only 10 images from each categories are used as training and test data.
